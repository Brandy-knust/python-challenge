Homework 3 - Python-Challenge
We were tasked this week with two different analyses. One was to look at banking data for several months and analyze changes over time. We found the data for total, change, greatest change, and least change. 
We were also tasked with looking at polling data for an election. We had four candidates that received various numbers of votes. We had to total the numbers of votes by candidate, and then calculate the percentages and determine the winner.
With each of these, we worked with Python and printed the final values both in the terminal and into text files.
